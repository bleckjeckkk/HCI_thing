const poem = `
  I walked under the rising sun
  Sea breeze - salty and fresh
  I walked blind, undone
  Blood oozing under my flesh

  I saw you - laying, unmoving
  Your eyes closed but fresh tears were flowing like a hidden waterfall
  Secretive, painful but full of beauty
  Tantalizing, fresh, but haunting

  To reach out, to touch - I walk blind, no more
  Too good at hiding, too good at subtle byes
  I watched you leaving the bright light of the sun and the salty, fresh breeze
  You were leaving and I was watching
  How did I not know that you were leaving with my soul?

  I met you when the sun was tired
  Your eyes open and happiness too faulty like waves
  To reach out, to touch - you remained secretive of your pain
  You were leaving and I was watching 
  How did I not know that you were leaving with my heart?

  I walked under the pouring rain
  Darkness seeping in my clothes and veins
  Walking yet again blindly
  Following a path I do not know

  The heavy rain so strong it hurts
  I found myself to the place I learned:
  You were there - eyes closed but a smile on your face
  To reach out, to touch- your secrets unfold
  How did I not know that you were leaving for good?
        `;
